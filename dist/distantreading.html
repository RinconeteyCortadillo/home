                      	<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Close Reading vs. Distant Reading</h1>
                        <p>Distant reading is an approach towards literary analysis generally attributed to Franco Moretti (see, for example, <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii1/articles/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature">this article</a>). It stands in opposition to close reading: whilst close reading focuses on paying close attention to the content of individual texts, distant reading purposefully abstracts from the particularity of textual content. Instead, it seeks to find, observe, and visualise global features and patterns within a large corpus of texts.</p>
                        <p>This latter point must be stressed: distant reading concerns huge amounts of textual data, collected either synchronically or diachronically, and analysed in order to reveal large-scale literary or cultural tendencies.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, any distant reading techniques that we apply to a discrete and short text, such as “Rinconete y Cortadillo”, cannot achieve this aim. Nevertheless, distant reading techniques can be applied to a shorter text in order to prove and bolster quantifiably claims that a competent literary critic may make via intuition alone. Moretti calls this process ‘operationalizing’.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Hypothesis</h1>
                        <p>The following distant reading analysis will carry out several computations in order to investigate, quantify, and visualise the following intuition:</p>
                        <div class="mx-auto" style="width: 500px;">
				<p style="font-family:RCFont; font-size:20pt">Within “Rinconete y Cortadillo” there is a noteworthy imbalance between narration and character dialogue, which renders the short story more reminiscent of a dramatic text than a text written in prose</p>
			</div>
			<p>This hypothesis is seemingly manifest at many moments during the narrative:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>During the story’s opening, syncopated dialogue between the two young boys, Rinconete and Cortadillo, with very little narrator intervention or comment</li>
				<li>During the second half of the story, after entering into Monipodio’s brotherhood, when the dialogue between Rinconete and Cortadillo diminishes dramatically, and the two characters morph into observers of the dramas that unfold there</li>
				<li>During the musical interlude in Monipodio’s patio when Escalanta uses her clog as a tambourine, Gananciosa uses a broom as another impromptu instrument, and Monipodio smashes a plate to do the same, before all breaking out into song (this scene is pictured in the image at the top of this webpage)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whilst this hypothesis is inevitably marked by subjectivity - “noteworthy”, “imbalance”, and “reminiscent of” are qualitative terms - distant reading tools and techniques may nevertheless help us to prove or disprove its essence.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Initial Investigations: Most Frequent Words and Dominant Characters</h1><br>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<p>The first step we can take to carry out distant reading on the text is to upload the text onto Voyant Tools (<a href= “https://voyant-tools.org”>link</a>) in order to retrieve a visualisation of the text’s most common words, visualised to the right.</p>
					<p>From this, we learn that the most frequent word in the story is “dijo” (i.e. "said") (103 instances), followed by “Monipodio” (96 instances), followed by “respondió” (i.e. "responded") (62 instances).</p>
					<p>Despite being the title characters, Rinconete (55 instances) and Cortadillo (50 instances) are only mentioned by name half as much as Monipodio (even taking into account the name change that happens for both characters from Rincón and Cortado respectively which is reflected in these figures).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">
					<iframe style='width: 482px; height: 362px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?stopList=keywords-d5920a201c99c522cdbe6fd196d48c31&corpus=5af9a0d80bc95872ddcde16a8c991f75'></iframe>
				</div>
		    	</div>
		    	<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">
					<iframe style='width: 512px; height: 362px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-d5920a201c99c522cdbe6fd196d48c31&query=rinconete*&query=rinc%C3%B3n*&query=cortadillo*&query=cortado*&query=monipodio&mode=document&corpus=5af9a0d80bc95872ddcde16a8c991f75'></iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<p>The graph to the left visualises the intensity with which Monipodio, Rinconete, and Cortadillo are referenced throughout the duration of the text. We can clearly see: references to Rincón and Cortado at the text’s opening are high, drop around midway through the text when they meet Monipodio, to whom references soar, with references to Rinconete and Cortadillo never even reaching the heights of the text’s opening. This supports the hypothesis that the two title characters become bystanders to the ‘Monipodio Show’ as the text progresses.</p>
				</div>
		    	</div>
                        <p>The conclusions drawn from the Voyant graph are replicated when we upload the text into AntConc software and visualise the concordance plots of the terms “Monipodio”, “Rinconete/Rincón”, and "Cortadillo/Cortado”, seen below. These plots show the intensity of references to each of the three characters throughout the duration of the text.</p>

			</div>
			<p>“Dijo” (i.e. “said”) has emerged as the most frequent word in the text with 103 instances. This supports the hypothesis that the story is marked by frequent dialogue, with a narrator relegated to recounting speech. AntConc software allows us to investigate this in more detail.</p>
                        <p>Using this software we can measure that “dijo Monipodio” ("said Monipodio") occurs 22 times; “dijo Rincón/Rinconete” ("said Rincón/Rinconete") 14 times; and “dijo Cortado/Cortadillo” ("said Cortado/Cortadillo") 7 times. Again, Monipodio emerges as the dominant voice of the text when considering the most common marker of speech, "dijo". The images below represent the concordances (i.e. the key word in context) of each of these 3 eventualities.</p>
			<div class="row">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Finally, we know that “dijo” is the most frequent word in the text, and AntConc software allows us to nuance this further by searching simultaneously for this word’s lemma (“decir”, i.e. "to say/tell"), alongside many other forms, including: “dicho”, “dijeron”, “dijeran”, “dice”, “decía”, “digo”, and “diciendo” (past participle, third-person plural preterite, third-person plural imperfect subjunctive, third-person singular present, first-person and third-person singular imperfect, first-person singular present, and present participle, respectively).</p>
			<p>This search returns a total of 175 results. If we add to this the number of instances of “respondió” (62) (i.e. “responded”) this brings us to a total of 237, making markers of dialogue and speech an undeniablly strong feature of the lexicon of “Rinconete y Cortadillo”, making up 1.7% (237 out of 13,696) of the story's words. In total, the story contains 3,060 different words, making "dijo" and "respondió" 0.07% of this total.</p>

			<p>A summary of these results is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>In total, there are 278 paragraphs in the text. 189 of these are speech (68%) and 89 are narration (32%)</li>

			<p>We can deduce from these results and visualisations that two thirds of the body of the text is made up of speech, whilst only one third is made up of narration.

                        <p>Within the paragraphs of the text which are dedicated to speech, we can again use computational techniques to examine the division of speech amongst the three primary characters: Rinconete, Cortadillo, and Monipodio, obtaining the following results:</p>

			<p>A summary of these results is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In total, Rinconete speaks 34 times, Cortadillo speaks 22 times, and Monipodio speaks 48 times</li>
				<li>Considering that there are 189 instances of speech in the whole story this means that 18% of speech comes from Rinconete, 12% comes from Cortadillo, and 25% comes from Monipodio (with the other 45% coming from other characters)</li>
				<li>In the first half of the text, prior to meeting Monipodio, Rinconete speaks 18 times and Cortadillo speaks 18 times</li>
				<li>In the second half of the text, after meeting Monipodio, Rinconete speaks 16 times, Cortadillo speaks only 4 times, and Monipodio speaks 48 times</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These results are visualised in the following graphs.</p>

			</div>
			<p>We can deduce from these results and visualisations that, prior to meeting Monipodio, the dialogue between Rinconete and Cortadillo is evenly split. After meeting Monipodio, Cortadillo all but disappears, speaking only 4 times. And Monipodio manages to speak more times in the second half of the text than Rinconete speaks in both halves of the text. We can picture this clearly in the pie chart above, which demonstrates that Monipodio’s proportion of speech, when comparing between the three main characters, is nearly 50%. All of these conclusions support the hypothesis that Rinconete and Cortadillo take a step back and become observers after the entrance of Monipodio into the story.</p>
                        <hr>
			
			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Conclusions</h1>
			<p>In this section, distant reading techniques have been used to explore the hypothesis that: within “Rinconete y Cortadillo” there is a noteworthy imbalance between narration and character dialogue, which renders the short story more reminiscent of a dramatic text than a text written in prose.</p>
			<p>This has been examined in several ways:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>By ascertaining the most frequent words in the text</li>
				<li>By ascertaining the frequency with which references are made to the three main characters as the text progresses</li>
				<li>By ascertaining the proportion of the text which is made up of narrative, compared to the proportion made up of speech, in both halves of the text and more generally</li>
				<li>By ascertaining how much of the instances of speech in the text are spoken by Rinconete, Cortadillo, and Monipodio, in both halves of the story and more generally</li>
			</ul>

			<p>From these examinations, several conclusions can be drawn:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>“Rinconete y Cortadillo” is a text which undoubtedly has speech as a strong characteristic feature. This is shown by the fact that the most frequent word is “dijo” and the third most frequent word is “respondió”; and by the fact that paragraphs of speech make up two thirds of the text</li>
				<li>The characters Rinconete and Cortadillo begin as very active participants in the story but fade from view after entering Monipodio’s patio, where this character becomes the focus of the action. This is shown by the fact that references to the title characters diminish in the second half of the text, while references to Monipodio increase; by the fact that a quarter of all the story’s speech instances come from Monipodio, despite only being present for half of the narrative; by the fact that Monipodio speaks as many times as Rinconete and Cortadillo combined, despite only being present for half of the narrative; and by the fact that Cortadillo in particular all but fades from view in the second half of the text</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In other words, there is ample quantitative evidence which can be extracted from the story in support of our initial, intuitive hypothesis.</p>
			<hr>

			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Areas For Further Study</h1>
			<p>A limitation of carrying out this process of distant reading on one single, short story is that, for all the evidence we gather, we have nothing to compare it to in order to measure if what we are observing is noteworthy or not.</p>
			<p>In order for this evidence to really hold weight, similar analyses need to be carried out on all of the novellas of the “Novelas ejemplares”, and perhaps even on Cervantes’ other works, such as “Don Quijote”. This analysis would allow us to ascertain, for example, whether the dominance of speech within “Rinconete y Cortadillo” is particularly noteworthy within Cervantes’ oeuvre more generally.</p>
                        <p>The “Novelas ejemplares” are often classified as ‘idealistic’ or ‘realistic’, with those of each group considered to share certain characteristics. The following visualisations compare the novellas of the “Novelas ejemplares”, as well as “Don Quijote” using a measure of stylistic similarity, with slightly tweaked parameters in the two diagrams.</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" style="text-align:center">
					<img src="Dendogram.png" style="height:450px"></img>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" style="text-align:center">
					<img src="RClusterAnalysis2.png" style="height:450px"></img>
				</div>
			</div>
                        <p>Here, we can see that the traditional classification of the novellas is computationally quite accurate. However, in the first diagram, there are some surprises regarding “El Licenciado Vidriera”, “La Gitanilla”, and “La Fuerza de la Sangre”. The second diagram, in this respect, is closer to critics’ usual classification. The differences between these two diagrams, which result from slightly altering the way in which the texts are compared, could be interesting to explore further using computational, distant reading techniques.</p>
