			 <h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Motivation and Intended Audience</h1>
                        <p>This project has been carried out to fulfil the requirements for the module 'Digital Text in the Humanities: Theories, Methodologies, and Applications' of the masters-level degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, 2021-22. The intended audience for the Rinconete y Cortadillo Digital Edition project are English-speaking learners of Spanish, who are approaching language-learning via literature.</p>
                        <p>More specifically, the inspiration behind this project comes from my own experience as an undergraduate student: “Rinconete y Cortadillo” is a set-text for all first-year students of Spanish at Oxford University. At this point, most first-year students are 18 years old, and do not yet have experience of living in Spain and acquiring fluency in the language. Approaching a seventeenth-century text under these circumstances can be very challenging. The motivation behind this project is to make the text as accessible as possible for young students in these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I now hold a PhD in Spanish literature (available <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:da6c5cc1-2a86-481e-b411-6962673b7883/download_file?safe_filename=Acquired_Ingenuity_The_Conflation_of_Prudence_with__Ingenio__in_the_Works_of_Baltasar_Gracian.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis">here</a>), specialising in prose writing of the Spanish Golden Age. Furthermore, I currently live in Seville. Given my own experiences as an undergraduate, my expertise in Spanish prose, and my contextual circumstances, the inspiration for the Rinconete y Cortadillo Digital Edition project came naturally.</p>

			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Basic TEI Mark-Up</h5>
                        <p>The first step in preparing the text for this project was to carry out a process of basic TEI mark-up. TEI stands for the Text Encoding Initiative and represents an attempt to standardise the XML mark-up of literary texts, focusing on the semantics of texts, rather than their presentational characteristics. As such, the TEI guidelines outline a set of XML elements, and corresponding attributes, which can be used to mark-up different kinds of texts, whether that be prose, poetry, or drama.</p>
                        <p>The least complex of these sets is for prose, as prose writing does not contain separate verses or stanzas written in different meters (poetry), or abrupt shifts from one speaker to another (drama).</p>
			<p>In terms of the body of the text of the story, at this stage, I decided to focus on only basic elements of the mark-up of prose texts. This included using the following elements:</p>
			 <ul>
				<li>The TEI &lt;head&gt; element to mark the title of the story</li>
				<li>The TEI &lt;p&gt; element to mark new paragraphs of text</li>
				<li>The TEI &lt;q&gt; element to mark when a character was speaking</li>
				<li>The TEI &lt;quote&gt; element to mark when the text, usually but not always spoken, was taken from a different source (e.g. a book within the story or a song)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having marked-up the whole of the text, both Spanish and English, I then created separate TEI files for the different chunks of text, corresponding with the facsimile images of the first edition. This step comprised creating 40 different TEI files for each of the 40 facsimile images. Several additional steps were required at this stage:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>The inclusion of the mandatory TEI &lt;teiHeader&gt; element, including the obligatory &lt;fileDesc&gt; element (to describe the bibliographic source of the TEI file) and the optional &lt;encodingDesc&gt; element (to provide extra information on how the source had been marked-up)</li>
				<li>The inclusion of the optional &lt;facsimile&gt; and &lt;graphic> elements between the &lt;teiHeader&gt; and &lt;text&gt; elements to represent the facsimile image source of the text</li>
				<li>The inclusion of Spanish and English text alongside each other, separated into different &lt;div&gt; elements and identified by the @xml:lang=“es” or @xml:lang=“en” attribute</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Below is an example of one of these TEI files.</p>

			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">XSLT: TEI to HTML (Using XPath)</h5>
                        <p>The next step towards creating the Rinconete y Cortadillo Digital Edition was to create an XSLT file. XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. In this case, I needed to transform my 40 TEI files into HTML files, in order to be able to upload and display their content on the Web.</p>
			<p>In order to create an XSLT file, the TEI XML elements need to be mapped onto suitable HTML XML elements. We reference the TEI elements using XPath – a language to describe how to locate a particular part of an XML document, based on XML’s fundamental tree-of-nodes structure. Furthermore, the desired lay-out of the HTML page needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
			<p>Since, at this stage, my TEI mark-up was basic, the use of XPath within the XSLT was relatively simple:</p>
                       	<ul>
				<li>“//tei:facsimile/tei:graphic/@url” was used to navigate the TEI document and retrieve the path of the facsimile image</li>
				<li>“//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘es’]” and “//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘en’]” were used to identify the sections of Spanish and English text</</li>
				<li>“//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘es’]/tei:head” and “//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘en’]/tei:head” were used to identify the text’s titles in both Spanish and English</li>
				<li>“//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘es’]/tei:p” and “//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘en’]/tei:p” were used to locate paragraphs</li>
				<li>“//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘es’]/tei:quote” and “//tei:text/tei:body/tei:div[@xml:lang=‘en’]/tei:quote” were used to locate the parts of the texts which are quoted from other sources</li>
				<li>No XPath query was necessary to locate TEI &lt;q&gt; elements as these were always contained within TEI &lt;p&gt; elements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having located these elements of the TEI document, the XSLT templates gave instructions to perform the following transformations:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>To transform a TEI &lt;head&gt; element into an HTML &lt;h2&gt; element</li>
				<li> To transform a TEI &lt;p&gt; element into an HTML &lt;p&gt; element of font-size 13pt</li>
				<li> To transform a TEI &lt;quote&gt; element into an HTML &lt;i&gt; element in order for the text to appear in italics </li>
				<li>Instructions were also given to ignore the contents of the TEI &lt;teiHeader&gt; element via the XPath “//tei:teiHeader”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The XSLT template applied to all 40 TEI files can be seen below, obscured somewhat by the necessity of including Bootstrap style information.</p>

			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Open Sea Dragon Image Viewer</h5>
                        <p>The image viewer Open Sea Dragon was chosen to present the facsimile images of the first edition of the text. Open Sea Dragon is an open-source, web-based viewer for high-resolution, zoomable images. This viewer was chosen, over Mirador for example, due to its streamlined interface, which gives precedence to the image itself and does not impose obtrusive user controls at the side of the image.</p>
                        <p>The images of the facsimile edition were provided by the Biblioteca Nacional de España, via its digitisation project entitled the Biblioteca Digital Hispánica. These images were provided in PDF format. Each image was therefore converted to a JPG.</p>
                        <p>In the process of presenting these images via the Open Sea Dragon viewer, efforts were made to augment the quality of the zoom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Firstly, photo tiles were created for each image via an application called Zoomify. The purpose of the tiles is to provide a deeper zoom of each segment of the image. However, when Zoomify was written into the Open Sea Dragon code, it failed to function. Further research showed that Zoomify has gone obsolete, despite still being recommended on the Open Sea Dragon webpage</li>
				<li>Secondly, efforts were made to convert the JPG file into a DZI file (Deep Zoom Image) using some of the convertor tools recommended by Open Sea Dragon for doing so. Again, this section of the Open Sea Dragon webpage seemed dated and none of the convertors investigated were fruitful</li>
			</ul> 
			<p>As such, it was decided that, for the purposes of these particular images and this particular edition – containing facsimile images of a printed edition, without handwriting or excessively small details – the use of Open Sea Dragon with a simple JPG file provided a high enough quality of zoom.</p>
			<p>A note on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF): the preferable format via which to present these images would have been IIIF. IIIF is a set of common APIs (such as the Image API and the Presentation API) that support interoperability between image repositories, providing scholars with uniform and rich access to image-based resources from around the world. IIIF images are characterised by their JSON-LD format manifests containing metadata in a standardised way via its manifest, sequence, canvas, and content sections. Since the cultural institution from which I acquired my facsimile images does not use IIIF, I was unable to curate my own IIIF manifests for these images, which would have been the preferable step to take.</p>

			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Seville Map</h1>
			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">KML File</h5>
                        <p>The first step towards creating the map of Rinconete and Cortadillo’s Seville was to create a KML file. KML stands for Keyhole Mark-Up Language and is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualisation within 2D maps and 3D earth browsers, originally developed for use with Google Earth.</p>
                        <p>An attempt was made to automate the creation of the necessary KML file via Recogito – a free, web-based tool for the semantic annotation of texts – by uploading the text of the short story and running an automatic Named Entity Recognition scan. However, the software failed to recognise even one of the necessary locations, and failed to accept them as valid locations when inputted manually.</p>
			<p>The KML file was therefore created from scratch and contains the following information on the 13 geographical locations explicitly mentioned in the text, each contained within its own &lt;Placemark&gt; element:</p>
                       	<ul>
				<li>The place name, contained within the &lt;name&gt; element</li>
				<li>A short description of how this place is mentioned within the text and its role within Seville today, contained within the &lt;description&gt; element</li>
				<li>An image of the location using the &lt;img&gt; tag, also contained within the &lt;description&gt; element </li>
				<li>The geographical longitude and latitude co-ordinates of the location, contained within the &lt;Point&gt; and then the &lt;coordinates&gt; elements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This KML file can be viewed below.</p>
			<div style="height:450px; overflow:auto" class="border border-2 border-dark rounded">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/RebeccaJillianBeattie/18c0155ef2cb75d5319f31ef1e8066c4.js"></script>
			</div><br>
				
			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Google Maps</h5>
                        <p>Once the KML file has been written the process of creating a customised Google Map is simple: upload the KML file into Google Maps, set the map as public, and copy the HTML embed code provided by Google.</p>

			<h1 style="font-family:RCFont" class="text-center">Distant Reading</h1>
			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Voyant</h5>
                        <p>Voyant Tools (<a href=“https://www.voyant-tools.org>link</a>) is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts, designed to facilitate reading and interpretation.</p>
                        <p>My primary use of this tool in the Rinconete y Cortadillo Digital Edition project was to visualise the most frequent words in the text. In order to get a reliable and useful result I had to expand the site’s automatic Stopwords list to incorporate some frequent tokens, such as “eso”, “esto”, “ese”, “este”, “a”, “que”, “les”, “le”, “mi”, “mí”, “son”, “sea”, “hemos”, “había”, “habían”, “él”, “ella”, “te”, “os”, “vos”, and “no”. These words are common but negligible, representing possessive pronouns, demonstrative adjectives, indirect objects, subject pronouns, prepositions, and verbal auxiliaries.</p><br>
			    
			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">AntConc</h5>
                        <p>AntConc is a freely-available corpus search and concordancing programme. It permits all basic corpus data extraction functionalities, including retrieving concordances, word lists, and collocations. Its downside is that it uses a linear search algorithm, instead of a binary search, making it slow for larger corpora. For the purposes of this project, with a very small corpus, it was sufficient.</p>
                        <p>Various aspects of this software were used for various different purposes:</p>
                        <ul>
				<li>Its concordance plot functionality was used to confirm the precedence of direct references to Monipodio, compared to references to Rinconete and Cortadillo. This result was obtained by searching with the regular expressions: /Monipodio/, /Rinconete|Rincón/, and /Cortadillo|Cortado/</li>
				<li>Its concordance/key word in context functionality was used to confirm that the word “dijo” occurs most frequently alongside “Monipodio”, compared to “Rinconete” and “Cortadillo”. This result was obtained by searching with the regular expressions: /dijo\sMonipodio/, /dijo\s(Rinconete|Rincón)/, and /dijo\s(Cortadillo|Cortado)/</li>
				<li>And it was also used to enumerate the number of instances in which the lemma of “dijo” occurred, alongside several other variations. This result was obtained by searching with the regular expression: /[Dd]i(jo|cho|jeron|jeran|ciendo)|[Dd]ec(ir|ía)/</li>
			</ul><br>
  
			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Enhanced TEI Mark-Up</h5>
                        <p>In order to elevate the process of distant reading to the next level, it was next necessary to build upon the basic TEI mark-up which had already been carried out. In addition to the &lt;head&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;quote&gt; elements which had already been included, several other annotations were made to the TEI mark-up.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the TEI Header, the following alterations were made:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The &lt;encodingDesc&gt; element, and all it contained, was removed from the &lt;teiHeader&gt, as this TEI mark-up no longer referred to a particular transcription </li>
				<li>A &lt;profileDesc&gt; element was added to the &lt;teiHeader&gt;. This tag is used for the description of non-bibliographic aspects of texts (such as characters and places). Within a &lt;particDesc&gt; tag I added a &lt;listPerson&gt; tag, within which is listed all the characters in the story using the tags &lt;person&gt; and &lt;persName&gt;. Within the &lt;person&gt; tag I also gave each character an @xml:id attribute. Furthermore, within a &lt;settingDesc&gt; tag I added a &lt;listPlace&gt; tag, within which is listed all the places mentioned in the story using the tags &lt;place&gt; and &lt;placeName&gt;. Within the &lt;place&gt; tag I also gave each place an @xml:id attribute</li>
				<li>A &lt;xenoData&gt; element was added to the &lt;teiHeader&gt;. This element provides a container for metadata in non-TEI format. In this case I inserted a host of metadata in RDF triple format within a &lt;rdf:RDF&gt; tag. This included general metadata on the bibliographic resource, utilising Dublin Core (e.g. title, creator, contributor, publisher, data, language). It also included RDF triples for each of the story’s characters (I created URIs to represent them, using the Github page of the project as a base). And this section also included RDF triples for the places mentioned in the story (most URIs to represent places were taken from Wikipedia, whilst a few also had to be created in the same way as for characters)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The enhanced TEI header can be viewed below (note: this is an incomplete TEI file, containing just the &lt;teiHeader&gt;)</p>
			<div style="height:450px; overflow:auto" class="border border-2 border-dark rounded">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/RebeccaJillianBeattie/48ce48726e8c60ea152e328e339ab1e5.js"></script>
			</div>
			<p>In terms of the TEI text and body:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The text was separated by two &lt;div&gt; elements with attribute @n=“1” and @n=“2” respectively. This was to represent the rough division of the action of the text between before and after entering the patio of Monipodio’s brotherhood</li>
				<li>Within all &lt;q&gt; tags two attributes were added: @who=“#” and @toWhom=“#”, allowing the annotation of who exactly is speaking in each instance of speech, and to whom they are directing their speech</li>
				<li>The 13 geographical locations presented in the Seville Map section, were also marked-up using a &lt;placename&gt; tag</li>
			</ul>
                        <p>The entire enhanced TEI mark-up of the text can be viewed below.</p>

			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">XQuery</h5>
                        <p>In order to carry out the distant reading section entitled, “Instances of Speech: Proportions of Text and Between Characters”, XQuery was used.</p>
                        <p>XQuery is a language for finding and extracting elements and attributes from XML documents, which utilises XPath. It is based upon the FLWOR iteration syntax, standing for: ‘for’, ‘let’, ‘where’, ‘order by’, and ‘return’, referring to the components which make up an XQuery query.</p>
			<p>I used XQuery to search through the tags of my enhanced TEI file in order to retrieve useful quantitative information regarding the number of &lt;p&gt; elements there are in the story, the number of &lt;q&gt; elements there are (bearing in mind that all &lt;q&gt; elements are contained within &lt;p&gt; elements), and the number of &lt;q&gt; tags that are spoken by Rinconete, Cortadillo, and Monipodio, using the @who=“#” attribute. In the process I ran queries to answer the following questions (the output of each query is contained in brackets).</p>

			<h5 style="font-family:RCFont">Stylometry using the R Stylo Package</h5>
                        <p>In order to broaden the horizons of the distant reading analysis, a process of stylometry was carried out. Stylometry measures authorial style allowing us, for example, to carry out authorship attribution or compare texts within the oeuvre of one writer.</p>
                        <p>Stylo is a stylometry analysis package for R, a programming language for statistical computing. It uses Delta as a measure of stylistic difference based on word frequency. A dendogram cluster analysis was used since the purpose of this analysis was to visualise which texts most closely resemble each other, which a dendogram facilitates by grouping similar texts closer together.</p>
                        <p>The first dendogram used the following parameters: plain text, language: Spanish, UTF-8; words, ngram size: 1; MFW minimum/maximum: 100; cluster analysis, delta distance: classic delta.</p>
			<p>The second dendogram used the following parameters: plain text, language: Spanish, UTF-8; words, ngram size: 1; MFW minimum: 100, MFW maximum: 2000; cluster analysis, delta distance: cosine delta.</p>
                        <p>The difference between the first and second example is that the first analysis is based on the 100 most frequent words and the classic delta distance, whilst the second is based on the 2000 most frequent words and the cosine delta distance. The latter parameters are generally accepted as more reliable, and it was noted that this dendogram also conforms more closely with what has been observed by critics through intuition.</p>
